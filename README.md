About the dataset:
This data was entirely scraped via the Goodreads API. 

Inspiration: 
The reason behind choosing this dataset is pretty straightforward, as I'm an avid reader and a book-lover. So exploring the book dataset irrespective of the language and publication, and use it to determine what what book to be reading next.


Aim:
The goal is to generate a dataset for the project, from the link above. The criteria is to have 100 rows randomly chosen from the main dataset and then to study the data to formulate a question and leverage the Wikidata kniowledge base to answer the formulated question.


### Query: "What genres of books have historically generated the highest reader engagement, and in what years were these highly engaging books predominantly published?"
